  "about": "OOJED is an end-to-end clean energy engineering and delivery firm serving customers across India. We design, manufacture, supply, install and maintain solar water heating, rooftop and hybrid solar power systems, solar pumping solutions, and Solar LED street & flood lighting. From the first site survey and feasibility study through design, permitting, procurement, installation, commissioning and long-term maintenance (AMC), our teams manage the entire project lifecycle so you get predictable performance and clear commercial outcomes.\n\nOur approach combines practical on-site engineering, factory-tested assemblies and local field teams for rapid commissioning. We optimise systems for local conditions—hard water, grid instability and roof constraints—using polymer-coated tanks, surge-protected drivers, MPPT/VFD controllers for pumps, and Tier-1 panels and inverters where required. We also support net-metering, subsidy paperwork and documentation for developers, institutions and municipalities. Contact us for a site survey and a tailored, itemised proposal.",
