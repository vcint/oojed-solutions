  "about": "OOJED Solutions designs, manufactures, and installs dependable clean-energy systems across Maharashtra. We specialise in solar water heating, rooftop/hybrid solar power, solar pumping, and LED street/flood lighting. This is our direct engineering & delivery arm—no marketplace middle layers. You get in-house design, factory-tested assemblies, and a local field service team for rapid commissioning and responsive after-sales.\n\nWe prioritise real-world performance: polymer-coated tanks for hard-water regions, surge-protected LED drivers for grid fluctuations, accurate pump sizing for required head/flow, and solar PV designed for your roof and policy (net-metering, subsidy). Developers and municipalities get documentation, layout assistance, and on-site support. Request a site survey or an itemised quotation to get started.",
